======================= Environment & Dependencies ========================
Anaconda version used: anaconda3-4.4.0


=============================== Instruction ===============================
Project 2: jupyter notebook (.ipynb) is included which contains all questions.
All cells can be run through Jupyter notebook. We also stored some models in pickle files for problem 11 since it will take an hour to train and run for 20 categories.

To save time, we lowered max_iter and n_init for problem 12 to small numbers but it still takes roughly 1 min to run.
