======================= Environment & Dependencies ========================
Anaconda version used: anaconda3-4.4.0


=============================== Instruction ===============================
Project 1 jupyter notebook (.ipynb) is included which contains all questions.
All cells can be run through Jupyter notebook, however it is not advised to do so since Grid Search does take a substantial amount.
Alternatively, we stored the objects in picke files using Pickle package so it can be loaded and trained the models faster.
Pickle is a way to store trained models in a file rather than re running it every time.
User can decide to either run everything again or use pickle files.
